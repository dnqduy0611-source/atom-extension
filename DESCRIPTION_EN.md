# 🌌 ATOM: The Attention Operating System (v5.3.0 Beta)

> Reclaim your mind from the algorithm. Start with a breath.

---

## 💡 The Problem

The internet is designed to steal your time. ATOM was created to give it back.

You sit down to work, but 30 minutes later, you find yourself deep in the endless "scroll hole." It's not your fault—modern newsfeeds are optimized to exploit the dopamine system in your brain. Blocking them feels restrictive, but ignoring them is impossible.

**Let ATOM help you.** It's not a crude web blocker—ATOM is a **mindful companion**. It lives quietly in your browser, observes your scrolling momentum, and only intervenes subtly when you start drifting too far.

## ✨ WHY YOU'LL LOVE ATOM

### 🌊 Protect Your Flow, Don't Break It
ATOM runs 100% locally on your machine. It's smart enough to distinguish between "active research" and "mindless doomscrolling." It respects your work, but is ready to catch you when you slip into distraction.

### 🧘 "Minimal Intervention First" Philosophy
Most web blockers use heavy-handed tactics immediately. ATOM uses psychology:

- **Presence Orb**: A subtle visual cue reminding you of your presence.
- **Micro-Closures**: A gentle question: "Ready to wrap up this session?"
- **Circuit Breakers**: If the dopamine loop is too strong, ATOM activates deep focus modes—Breathing, Stillness, or Tap & Hold—to reset your nervous system to balance.

### 🧠 Mirror for Your Mind (AI Powered)
Connect your own Gemini API Key to turn ATOM into an empathetic coach. Instead of making you feel guilty, ATOM asks: "Are you bored, anxious, or just tired?" helping you understand the root cause behind your scrolling habits.

### 🛡️ Absolute Privacy
- **No Tracking**: Your browsing history never leaves your device.
- **Your Key, Your Data**: AI features only activate if you proactively connect your own API Key.
