# AmoNexus Icon Design Brief

**Brand Core:** Intelligence, Connection, Focus, "Second Brain".
**Keywords:** Nexus, Synapse, Neural, Clean, Flow.
**Primary Colors:** Emerald (`#10B981`), Teal (`#0D9488`), White/Silver (`#F0FDFA`).

## Design Principles
1.  **Scalability:** Must look good at 16x16px (favicon) and 128x128px (Store).
2.  **Minimalism:** Avoid complex details. Use simple geometric shapes.
3.  **Contrast:** The "Amo" green must pop against both Dark and Light browser themes.

## Concept Proposals

### Option 1: The Synapse (Kết nối thần kinh)
*   **Visual:** A central circle (the core thought) connected to 2 or 3 smaller orbiting dots by thin, clean lines.
*   **Meaning:** Represents the extension connecting your browsing (dots) to your knowledge base (center). It hints at a neural network.
*   **Shape:** Asymmetrical balance.
*   **Vibe:** Dynamic, Scientific, Active.

### Option 2: The Nexus Orb (Giao điểm hội tụ)
*   **Visual:** A solid emerald circle with a "cut" or a "path" flowing through it (like a letter 'N' or a lightning bolt of insight) in negative space (white/transparent).
*   **Meaning:** AmoNexus is the lens through which you view the web. Focusing energy.
*   **Shape:** Perfect Circle or Squircle.
*   **Vibe:** Stable, Premium, Trustworthy.

### Option 3: The Focus Lens (Thấu kính tập trung)
*   **Visual:** Two overlapping circles (transparency effect) creating a bright "leaf" shape in the intersection.
*   **Meaning:** The intersection of "Attention" and "Intention". The "Leaf" shape also nods to the original nature/growth theme of "Amo".
*   **Shape:** Geometric Intersection.
*   **Vibe:** Organic, Growth, Clarity.

## Recommended Specification
*   **Background:** Transparent (for extension icons) or Dark Slate `#111827` (for Store tiles).
*   **Main Element:** Solid `#10B981` (Emerald).
*   **Accent:** `#34D399` (Light Emerald) for gradients.
*   **Stroke Width:** Bold interactions (if using lines), minimum 2px at 32px scale.
