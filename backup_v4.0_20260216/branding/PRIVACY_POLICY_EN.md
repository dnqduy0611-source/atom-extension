# Privacy Policy for AmoNexus

**Last updated:** February 01, 2026

**AmoNexus** ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our browser extension and related services.

By using AmoNexus, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Core Principles
*   **Privacy First:** We do not track your browsing history for advertising purposes.
*   **Local Data:** Your data (journals, settings, reading history) is stored locally on your device or in your personal Chrome Sync storage.
*   **User Control:** You have full control over your API keys and data usage.

## 2. Information We Collect

### A. Personal Data
We do **not** collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or phone number on our servers.
*   **Journal Entries:** Entries you write in the Atom Journal are stored locally within the browser's storage system.
*   **API Keys:** If you provide a Google Gemini API Key, it is encrypted and stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this key.

### B. Usage Data & Content
To provide the "Active Reading" and "Chat with Amo" features, the extension requests permissions to access the content of the web pages you visit.
*   **Page Content:** When you trigger the AI features (e.g., summarize, chat), text from the active tab is temporarily read and sent to the selected AI Provider (e.g., Google Gemini) for processing.
*   **Focus Data:** We store statistics about your focus sessions (duration, breaks taken) locally to help you visualize your productivity.

## 3. How We Use Your Information
We use the collected information solely for the purpose of providing the extension's functionality:
*   **AI Processing:** To generate summaries, answer questions, and perform sentiment analysis on your journal entries.
*   **Focus & Wellness:** To trigger "Micro-interventions" (breathing guides, break reminders) based on your browsing patterns (e.g., doomscrolling detection).
*   **Synchronization:** To sync your settings across your devices using Chrome Sync.

## 4. Third-Party Services

### Google Gemini API
Atom Nexus uses Google's Gemini models for intelligence features.
*   When you use AI features, date snippets are sent to Google's API.
*   If you use the built-in free tier, data is processed according to [Google's AI Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms).
*   If you use your own API Key, data privacy is governed by your agreement with Google Cloud Platform.

### NotebookLM
*   If you choose to export content to NotebookLM, you are interacting directly with Google's NotebookLM service. Atom Nexus merely bridges the data transfer.

## 5. Data Security
*   **Local Storage:** Most sensitive data remains on your machine.
*   **Encryption:** API keys are stored securely using browser storage APIs.
*   **No External Servers:** We do not operate a backend server to store your personal user data.

## 6. Your Rights
Since we do not store your data on central servers, you own your data completely.
*   **Access:** You can view all your stored data via the Extension's "Memory" or "Settings" panel.
*   **Deletion:** You can reset/delete all local data using the "Reset" button in the Settings menu. Uninstalling the extension will also remove all local data.

## 7. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the extension's release notes.

## 8. Contact Us
