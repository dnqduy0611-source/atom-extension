# AGENTS.md (Project instructions for Codex)

## Read-first
- This repo was scaffolded with Antigravity-style agent files in `.agent/`.
- Before starting any task, read:
  - `.agent/GEMINI.md` (primary conventions & workflows)
  - `.agent/` folder for skills/workflows/modules if referenced.

## Working style
- Be bias-for-action: explore the repo first, then propose changes.
- Prefer small, reviewable commits.
- When you change code, also update docs/tests if applicable.

## Safety / repo hygiene
- Do not commit secrets (API keys, tokens).
- If you generate new files, keep them minimal and consistent with existing structure.

## Definition of done
- Code compiles / runs.
- Basic tests or smoke commands run (if present).
- Update README or docs when behavior changes.
